"""
A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that enables its customers 
to order groceries online. After a customer completes an order, the online service 
sends a CSV file that contains the customerâ€™s requests to the grocery store. 
The store needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to the 
terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and shows the subtotal, 
the sales tax amount, and the total.
